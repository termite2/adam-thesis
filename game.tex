\chapter{Driver Synthesis as a Game}

In this chapter we formalise the device driver synthesis problem using games. We show that GR(1) games are sufficient to capture the properties of the drivers that we require. We also develop the driver synthesis controllable predecessor.

\section{Formalism}

\todo{define the players}

\subsection{Concurrent games}

Our game formalism for termite makes use of concurrent games. Concurrent games differ from simpler turn based games in that in each state both players get to pick a label and the next state that the game transitions to is some function of both of those labels. Turn based games are a special case of concurrent games where in player~i states the next state is entirely determined by the label played by player~i and the other player's label is ignored. 

It is important to specify which player gets to pick their label first and if the second player gets to have knowledge of the label that the first player picks when choosing their label. In Termite, player~1 (the driver) has to pick first and the environment (device and operating system) gets to pick second with knowledge of the label that the driver picked. This makes the game more difficult to win for the driver.

We call the part of the label that the driver gets to pick $C$ (for controllable) and the part that the environment gets to pick $U$ (for uncontrollable). Our transition relation is defined over the current state $S$, as well as the label $C$ and $U$. Our controllable predecessor becomes:

\begin{equation}
    CPre(X) = \exists C. \forall U. \forall N. TRANS(S, C, U) \rightarrow X'
\end{equation}

We define a special variable that is part of the environment's label called \textsc{Turn}.

\section{A specification Language for Symbolic Games}

We describe a simple specification language for symbolic games. This language is used to illustrate, in the simplest possible way, how Termite's specifications work. Furthermore, I have created a compiler for this language as an alternate frontend for Termite and it is available as part of Termite. As a result, all of the examples given in this chapter will compile and synthesize with Termite.

Fundamentally, symbolic transition systems are specified by defining how each state variable is updated on each transition, as a function of the other state variables and the label variables. We call these functions update functions and there is one update function for each state variable. 

Our simple language consists of three sections for defining a transition system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The state variable declaration
    \item The label variable declaration
    \item Variable update functions, one for each state variable
\end{itemize}

Variables in both the state and label sections may be declared as one of three types:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fixed width integer
    \item Boolean
    \item Enumeration
\end{itemize}

The transition relation is specified using nested case statements.

The BNF grammar is given below.

\subsection{Identifiers}

An identifier is a name of a variable or a constant declared as part of an enumeration.

\begin{bnflisting}
    <ident>    := <letter> (<letter> | <digit> | "_")*
\end{bnflisting}

\subsection{Numbers}

Numbers may be specified in hexadecimal, octal or decimal.

\begin{bnflisting}
    <number>    := "0x" <hexNumber>
                 | "0o" <octNumber>
                 | <decNumber>
\end{bnflisting}

\subsection{Types}

Our specification language supports three different types: Booleans, fixed width bit vectors, and enumerations.

\begin{bnflisting}
    <boolTyp>  := "bool"
    <intTyp>   := "uint" "<" <digit>* ">"
    <enumTyp>  := "{" identifier* "}"
\end{bnflisting}

\subsection{Variables}

Variables are declared by giving a name of the variable and its type.

\begin{bnflisting}
    <type>     := <boolTyp> | <intTyp> | <enumTyp>
    <varDecl>  := <identifier> ":" <type>
\end{bnflisting}

\subsection{Boolean Expressions}

Boolean expressions consist of boolean literals, value expressions (to follow) combined with the equality operator, and other boolean expressions combined with logical connectives.

\begin{bnflisting}
    <boolLit>  := "true" | "false"
    <binExpr>  := <boolLit> 
                | <valExpr> "==" <valExpr> 
                | <binExpr> "||" <binExpr> 
                | <binExpr> "&&" <binExpr> 
                | "!" <binExpr>
\end{bnflisting}

\subsection{Value Expressions}
Each value expression is a number, an identifier or a case statement. A case statement consists of a list of cases. Each case consists of a boolean condition followed by a value expression. Thus, case statements may contain further case statements. The outcome of a case statement is the value of the first case whose boolean expression evaluates to true.

\begin{bnflisting}
    <caseStmt> := "case" "{" 
                      (<binExpr> ":" <valExpr> ";")*
                  "}"
    <valExpr>  := <caseStmt> | <number> | <identifier>
\end{bnflisting}

\subsection{Variable updates}

Update functions are specified by assigning the next state value of a state variable to a value expression.

\begin{bnflisting}
    <update>   := <identifier> ":=" <valExpr>
\end{bnflisting}

\subsection{Transition System}

Transition systems are defined by giving the set of state variables, the set of label variables and the variable update functions.

\begin{bnflisting}
    <spec>     := "State" <varDecl>* 
                  "Label" <varDecl>* 
                  "Transitions" <update>*
\end{bnflisting}

\section{Device and OS specifications and synchronization}

A core concept of Termite is the separation of device and operating system specifications. Games so far have been defined to have a single state machine that contains all of the states of the system as well as all of the actions. In Termite, we decouple the description of the operating system from the device to be controlled and then combine these to form a state machine before synthesis.

Both the device and OS specifications are given as state machines. They are defined symbolically. Each specification has its own set of state variables that it must supply update functions for, however, one specification may refer to another's state variables in its state update functions. There is a global set of label variables which each specification may also refer to in its state update functions. An overview of a system consisting of a device and OS specification as well as their interconnections is given in figure \ref{fig:specs}.

As the figure shows, device and OS specifications are identical to modules in a hardware description language such as Verilog or VHDL. They consist of some private state, represented by D type flip-flops (though the variables are not restricted to single bits) that is updated solely by logic within that module. Other modules can read, but not write to, this private state. The label, that is chosen by one of the players, appears as input to both of the modules and they can use it in the update functions for their private state.

To ensure reusability of specifications, specifications do not directly refer to each other's state variables. Instead, they access them through well defined interfaces and there is a device class mechanism to standardise the interfaces of both the device and operating system specification interfaces. We delay description of this mechanism until Chapter \ref{c:userguided}. For now we assume that specifications can access each other's state variables without restriction.

\section{An Example System Specification}

\begin{asllisting}
State

osState  : {osIdle, osRequested, osDone, osError};
devState : {devIdle, devSending};

Label

osReqSend    : bool;
devClassSent : bool;
devSendReq   : bool;

Init

osState == osIdle && devState == devIdle && devData == 0

Transitions

devState := case {
    devState == devIdle    && devSendReq   : devSending;
    devState == devSending && devClassSent : devIdle;
    true                                   : devState;
};

define(sentEvent, (devState == devSending && devClassSent))
 
osState := case {
    osState == osIdle :
        case {
            devClassSent : osError;
            osReqSend    : osRequested;
            true         : osState;
        };
    osState == osRequested :
        case {
            devClassSent : osDone;
            true         : osState;
        };
    osState == osDone  : osDone;
    osState == osError : osError;
};
\end{asllisting}

\section{GR(1) based formalism}

In the following sections, we attempt to formalise the driver synthesis problem using the simplest game - the reachability game - and analyse its shortcomings. We show that extending our formalism to GR(1) objectives, as used in Termite, overcomes these shortcomings.

\subsection{Reachability}

As a concrete example, we could create a crude formalism for driver synthesis using only a reachability game. Consider, for example, figure \ref{fig:reach}, which shows the state machine for a game to control a hypothetical network controller. Solid lines indicate controllable transitions and dashed lines indicate uncontrollable transitions. Execution begins in the leftmost state where the OS may initiate a network transfer by choosing the `send' label. The goal of the game is the rightmost state (labelled `G') as this is the point where player 1 has completed the request. So, to win, player 1 (who controls the transitions with solid lines) must ensure that execution of the state machine reaches the goal. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics{diagrams/reachGame.pdf}
\caption{Reachability game for simple network device}
\label{fig:reach}
\end{figure}

The network device has two 8-bit registers, command (abbreviated cmd) and data. Writing 0x01 to the command register starts the transfer, and eventually whatever is in the data register gets written out to the network. Note that the actual sending of the data is an uncontrollable event. 

The correct sequence to win the game, therefore, is to write the data register and then the control register after the OS performs a send request. This takes us to state `S5' where the only move by player 2 is `evt\_send' taking us to the goal. 

If the command register is written first and then the data register there is potential for the environment to play the `evt\_send' label before the data is written, potentially resulting in the wrong data being sent. This is the transition that terminates in the `E' state (for error). The `E' state is a dead end, so it is not possible to reach the goal. 

So, if player 1 takes the top half of the diamond (ie. writes data before command) then it will be guaranteed to reach the goal and the reachability game is winning for player 1. The strategy to reach the goal tells us the sequence of labels the driver must play to get to the goal. In principle, this could be turned into a driver for our simple network device.

This simplistic formalism for driver synthesis has several shortcomings that we will deal with in the following sections.

\subsection{\buchi}

Consider a simplified network controller that does not have a command register. Instead, writing to the data register triggers transmission of the byte. However, there are two ways of writing to the data register. One is a standard register write. The other also performs the register write and then schedules a self destruct sequence to happen immediately after the byte is transmitted. The state machine for this device is shown in figure \ref{fig:buchi}. The goal, in this case, is the set ${S3, S5}$ corresponding to the state after completion of the send request. The problem is that, unless you only ever want to send one byte, this goal does not capture the required behavior. One could easily work around this problem by specifying only ${S3}$ as the goal, 

The solution is to modify the objective of the game. Instead of being able to reach the goal once, we want to be able to reach the goal an infinite number of times. Or, equivalently, we want to always be able to reach the goal again. This kind of objective is called a Buchi objective and a game with a Buchi objective is called a Buchi game. 

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics{diagrams/buchiGame.pdf}
\caption{Buchi game for simple network device}
\label{fig:buchi}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Fairness}

Consider a modification of our simplified network device without a self destruct sequence, but with the ability to check that noone is using the communication medium prior to transmitting. The state machine of this device is given in figure \ref{fig:fair}. After the user requests data transmission by writing to the data register, it executes a loop that checks if the medium is free, and if so, it performs the transmission. 

If we pose this as a reachability game with goal state $G$, then the game is not winnable. The device may stay in the loop forever as it is never guaranteed to exit. Such a behavior should not prevent a driver from being synthesized providing that we have good reason to believe that the loop will eventually exit. Looping forever can be seen as a invalid behavior and we want to synthesize a driver for this system providing the invalid behavior does not occur. 

In model checking these behaviors are eliminated with fairness conditions. Fairness conditions are sets of states which we guarantee will eventually be left, which we refer to as unfair states. In the example, the unfair states are the set ${S2, S3}$. The fairness condition says that we will eventually leave the unfair set, and the only way of doing this is through the $evt\_send$ transition, and the game becomes winning.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Multiple Goals}

\subsection{Multiple Fairness}

\subsection{GR(1)}

The combination of fairness and buchi objectives is called a GR(1) objective. Intuitively a GR(1) objective says that we can always reach some goal state provided that we do not get stuck forever in some unfair set of states. We use GR(1) objectives in Termite as we have found that in practice it is sufficient to express our goals.
